# Secure Chat App

### Why build this
My original thought for this project is to build a secure messanger application
that by the end can be installed on Linux, Windows, Mac, IOS, and Andriod

This messaging application would most likely have a market in business and maybe for individuals
that want to share their plans or commuincate with friends

I would like to create a program that can manage and store budget information for both individual users and companies. 
Additionally, it should enable users to maintain schedules and keep track of important dates. 
As the program evolves, I plan to incorporate features for assessing and sending basic commands to IoT devices that are registered by users.

#### NOTE:
This is ment to be a proof of concept at the end of the day.

Plaining:
DATABASE->DATABASE TEST AUTHENTICATION -> TUI/GUI 



BACKEND:
- HTTPS
- RESTFUL API 
-  authentication and security 
- JWT
- DOCKER

DATABASE:
